Writers at #SNL be like "this is the easiest job ever" #trump #USElections #Debate
So we as voters know that YES, CAN do the job , I.e. a great #debate outcome. But it took TWO failed attempts first. #WTF ?
please explain what has done to help fix the #economy so me and other smart people can debunk your argument. #debate
Oopsie!! Didnt she say TRUMP couldn't be trusted with Nuclear info? She and Biden are doing a fair job at screwing up!! #debate #Debatenight
Head of : election is rigged, 9/11 was an inside job , man never landed on the moon, the Holocaust never happened #debate
When will someone ask #Trump to stand by his words and begin bringing jobs back he sent overseas? #debate #debatenight
The problem is that he isn't a conservative. He's just a paranoid nut job . And that's a nice way to describe him. #debate
So, now Hillary is the champion for American jobs . Her 30 year history proves other wise. #debate

#debate I have no idea what topic they were suppose to be on anymore. I think economy ? Somehow we wound up in Syria.
#Trump did a much better job of completing thoughts and redirecting back to current question at last #debate
In effect. He's telling the 55% of Americans that approve of the job Obama is doing to vote for HRC. Genius idea DJT. #Debate #ClownTrain
The #economy was barely mentioned on last night's #debate
Great job , Mike Wallace moderating the 3rd #debate . should be proud to have you.
Still can't get past that HRC loudly proclaimed our Nuke response time on a #debate stage for world to hear. Nice job there. #NeverHillary
I wonder if when Trump wins the election democrats will sit by and say, "Oh good job Donnie! Yay democracy!" #debate

We can’t believe anything says about the economy . Here are 10 reasons why:

I HATE #FoxNews But Chris Wallace did a hell of a job moderating last night's #Debate . #ImWitHer #NeverTrump #NastyWoman
says Hillary got the questions before the #debate . Good lord, she knew he was going to ask what she’d do about the economy ?
really did a shit job of saying our nuclear launch response times. seriously. #debate #neverhillary #maga #podestaemails13
I agree "entitlements" as the problem with US economy instead of lack of revenue from top 1% ... made me cringe! #debate
Even though Dem #ChrisWallace did a good job at #Debate he never asked #Hillary if she would accept election results. I bet she won't. #Gore

These two? Is this really happening? The job of the moderator... #debate
#debate finally he is a bit more concise, she stopped grinning like a joker, and a moderator doing his job . 3rd time a charm I guess.
A lying racist sexist bully speaks as a buffoon abt foreign policy or smart woman who worked her whole life for the job . Easy choice #debate
